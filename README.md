## What is this?

This is my old minecraft modding attempt for minecraft java edition 1.19.4, 
a mod ehancing minecraft mushrooms 
by adding chanterelle mushroom variant


## What's it's current status?

The short answer: It's unmaintained

The long one: If you really want to do something with it - feel free to fork it or even send the merge request, i'll probably merge it, but I currently don't have enough time or will to continue it, so the project is essentially dead
